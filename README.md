# Fashion-Mnist-Classification-CNN-Deep-Learning

Based on Fashion MNIST, we can see that the dataset we will use has the following size :

- training data using 55,000 data samples
- testing data using 10,000 data samples
- data validation using 5000 data samples
which has a vector dimension of 784 or 28x28 pixels. Each data has an association label consisting of 10 classes

## Deep Learning
deep learning use three convolutional layers:

- The first layer will have 32-3 x 3 filters,
- The second layer will have 64-3 x 3 filters and
- The third layer will have 128-3 x 3 filters. In addition, there are three max-pooling layers each of size 2 x 2.
